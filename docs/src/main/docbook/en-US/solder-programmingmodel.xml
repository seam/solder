         <title>@Veto</title>
      
         <para>
            Annotating a class <code>@Veto</code> will cause the type to be ignored, such that any definitions on the 
            type will not be processed, including:
         </para>
      
         <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
               the managed bean, decorator, interceptor or session bean defined by the type
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               any producer methods or producer fields defined on the type
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               any observer methods defined on the type
            </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>
         
         <para>
            For example:
         </para>
         
         <programlisting role="JAVA">@Veto
class Utilities {
   ...
}</programlisting>

		<para>
			Besides, a package can be annotated with <code>@Veto</code>, causing all beans in the package to be prevented
			from registration.
		</para>
		
		<example>
			<title>package-info.java</title>
			<programlisting role="JAVA">@Veto
package com.example;

import org.jboss.seam.solder.core.Veto;</programlisting>
		</example>
         
         <note>
            <para>
               The <code>ProcessAnnotatedType</code> container lifecycle event will be called for vetoed types.
            </para>
         </note>
      
      </section>
   
      <section>
         <title>@Requires</title>
      
         <para>
            Annotating a class with <code>@Requires</code> will cause the type to be ignored if the class dependencies
            cannot be satisfied. Any definitions on the type will not be processed:
         </para>
         
         <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
               the managed bean, decorator, interceptor or session bean defined by the type
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               any producer methods or producer fields defined on the type
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
               any observer methods defined on the type
            </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>
         
         <tip>
            <para>
               Solder will use the Thread Context ClassLoader, as well as the classloader of the type annotated
               <code>@Requires</code> to attempt to satisfy the class dependency.
            </para>  
         </tip>
         
         <para>
            For example:
         </para>
         
         <programlisting role="JAVA">@Requires("javax.persistence.EntityManager")
class EntityManagerProducer {
   
   @Produces
   EntityManager getEntityManager() {
      ...
   }
   
}</programlisting>

		<para>
			Annotating a package with <code>@Requires</code> causes all beans in the package to be ignored if the class dependencies
            cannot be satisfied. If both a class and it's package are annotated with <code>@Requires</code>, both package-level and
            class-level dependencies have to be satisfied for the bean to be installed.
		</para>

   <section>
      <title>@Exact</title>
      
      <para>
         Annotating an injection point with <code>@Exact</code> allows you to select an exact implementation of the
         injection point type to inject. For example: 
      </para>
      
      <programlisting role="JAVA">interface PaymentService { 
   ...
}</programlisting>

      <programlisting role="JAVA">class ChequePaymentService implements PaymentService { 
   ...
}</programlisting>

      <programlisting role="JAVA">class CardPaymentService implements PaymentService { 
   ...
}</programlisting>

      <programlisting role="JAVA">class PaymentProcessor { 
   
   @Inject @Exact(CardPaymentService.class)
   PaymentService paymentService;
   
   ...
   
}</programlisting>
      
   </section>
   
   <section>
      <title>@Client</title>
      
      <para>
         It is common to want to qualify a bean as belonging to the current client (for example we want to differentiate
         the default system locale from the current client's locale). Seam Solder provides a built in qualifier,
         <code>@Client</code> for this purpose.
      </para>
      
   </section>
   
   <section>
      <title>Named packages</title>
      
      <para>
         Seam Solder allows you to annotate the package <code>@Named</code>, which causes every bean defined in the
         package to be given its default name. Package annotations are defined in the file 
         <code>package-info.java</code>. For example, to cause any beans defined in <code>com.acme</code> to be given
         their default name:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting role="JAVA">@Named
package com.acme</programlisting>
   </section>

   <section>
      <title>@FullyQualified bean names</title>

      <para>
         According to the CDI standard, the <code>@Named</code> annotation assigns a name to a bean equal to the value
         specified in the <code>@Named</code> annotation or, if a value is not provided, the simple name of the bean class.
         This behavior aligns is with the needs of most application developers. However, framework writers should avoid
         trampling on the "root" bean namespace. Instead, frameworks should specify qualified names for built-in components.
         The motivation is the same as qualifying Java types. The <code>@FullyQualified</code> provides this facility without
         sacrificing type-safety.
      </para>
      
      <para>
         Seam Solder allows you to customize the bean name using the complementary <code>@FullyQualified</code>
         annotation. When the <code>@FullyQualified</code> annotation is added to a <code>@Named</code> bean type, producer
         method or producer field, the standard bean name is prefixed with the name of the Java package in which the bean
         resides, the segments separated by a period. The resulting fully-qualified bean name (FQBN) replaces the standard
         bean name.
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA">package com.acme;
      
@FullyQualified @Named
public class NamedBean {
   public String getAge()
   {
      return 5;
   }
}</programlisting>

      <para>
         The bean in the previous code listing is assigned the name <code>com.acme.namedBean</code>. The value of its
         property <code>age</code> would be referenced in an EL expression (perhaps in a JSF view template) as follows:
      </para>

      <programlisting>#{com.acme.namedBean.age}</programlisting>

      <para>
         The <code>@FullyQualified</code> annotation is permitted on a bean type, producer method or producer field. It can
         also be used on a Java package, in which case all <code>@Named</code> beans in that package get a bean name which is
         fully-qualified.
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA">@FullyQualified
package com.acme;
</programlisting>

      <para>
         If you want to use a different Java package as the namespace of the bean, rather than the Java package of the bean,
         you specify any class in that alternative package in the annotation value.
      </para>

      <programlisting role="JAVA">package com.acme;
      
@FullyQualified(ClassInOtherPackage.class) @Named
public class CustomNamespacedNamedBean {
   ...
}</programlisting>
      
   </section>
